# EXPLANATIONS

When we create an object without initialization, the default constructor of the class of that object is executed. Similarly, if an object of the class inheriting another class, which is also called a derived class, is created then the default constructor of the derived class is called. However, before that, the default constructor of the base class which it inherits is called since the derived class has its base class's properties and methods and they can only be executed in the base class. So the most base class's constructor is invoked firstly, then calls the derived class's constructor according to the level of inheritance.

- In this case, clearly, when *b1* (-an object of class **Base**) is created, only default constructor of the base class is invoked. But when it comes to creating *da1*, *db1* (an object of derived class **DerivedA** and **DerivedB** respectively), the invocation of the default constructor of its own class is preceded by the one of its inherited class.

Mentioning parameterized constructor, we create an object of a class with initialized parameters. The constructors of a class with appropriate parameters will be called. For the call of the parameterized constructors of a derived class, if we want to call the parameterized constructor of the base class, we have to explicitly specify base class's parameterized constructor in a derived class. Otherwise, base class's default constructor is invoked. 
- For example, in the above code, parameterized constructor of **DerivedB** receiving an integer and a float value as parameters explicitly specify that of **Base** class with 1 parameter (an integer). Meanwhile, parameterized constructors of **DerivedA** do not explicitly call any parameterized constructor of class **Base**, resulting in the invocation of the default constructor of the **Base** class.

When an object of a class is passed-by-value to a function, a copy of object is conducted. Therefore, the copy constructor is invoked. Finishing executing within a function, it begins to call the destructor to destroy a copy of an object.
- In the above program, there are 3 functions *f*, each receives a pass-by-value object of **Base** class. Since objects of class **DerivedA** and **DerivedB** inherit all attributes and methods of **Base**, they are also an object of **Base** class, so copy constructor of **Base** is invoked. And exiting the function *f* results in calling a destructor of **Base** class.

When a pointer of the base class is initialized with a dynamically allocated memory address of its own class or its derived classes. Appropriate constructors is called with the same way as we create an object of class. And when we free the memory address allocated previously pointed by a pointer of the base class whether it is of base class or derived class, only the destructor of the base class is invoked.
- As we see the output, *Base \*pb = new Base(1)*, *pb=new DerivedA(4,5)*, *pb=new DerivedB(4,5)*, suitable constructors will be called for the allocated class. And when we *delete pb*, destructor of **Base** class is executed even though the pointer *pb* is currently pointing to the derived class.

Destructor call is in a reversed order of the constructor call. When we create an object of the derived class and the most base class's constructor is called first then comes to that of the derived class and when it gets down to object destruction, the destructor of the most derived class is called first then comes to that of the base class.
- As we can see, as soon as the program finishes (*main( )* function finishes executing), destructors of each created object from the top to the bottom of the *main( )* function is called. Specifically, destructions of objects of **DerivedA** or **DerivedB** have 2 destructor calls, one from the derived class followed by one from the **Base**.
